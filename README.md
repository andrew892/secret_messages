# secret_messages

it's just an exercise of mobile programming.  
You can save a message on the database indexed with the combination of two random italian words, so you can send to your friend a long text just send him only these two words.
He can recover and then read the message writing in the app these two words.

i committed just a server part of it.  
i'll commit soon the android client app.
